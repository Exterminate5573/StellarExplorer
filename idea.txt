ideas cuz google docs is blocked

progession
Phase 1 launch ships into space

mining ores start with free drill
use ores to make more drills
unlock ore refinement
make better drills
unlock ship building
use new materials to unlock more ship parts and drills
launch parts with ships
unlock making parts
have parts launched to space be bottle necks by ships
make more ships to make more parts

Phase 2 space exploration
at some point of enough parts in space station unlock space sataion inprovements
Improvemnts
  resarch place for upgrades globaly
  expeditions for exploring planets
  radar for discovering new planets
  shipping for moving resources thru planets
  mining for setting up minings
explore planets to gather resorces and upgrade the station further

Phase 3 Relic
throughot some planets find relic things
at some point find the core relic
unlock a minigame type thing where you power up the relic
relic being activated provides boosts
and allows other relics to be upgraded and used to power up the core relic
the open portal to the end of game/rebirth dimention

mechanics

refinement earth
    pay x amount of ores to make a refined ore. smelting time for each ore smelted
    different types of refined ores with different counts of ores
    different drills give different ores
    so that you can make differ refinements
    for mixed thins make them alloys

ships earth
  from earth ships will be single use and you need to construyct a new ship every time resources are launched ship cost increases
  per ship upgrade which is larger caryy size and fasterlaunch speeds and loading speeds
  each upgrades are in chunks like t1 t2 t3 to simplify
  upgrades
    larger carry size - more resources launched
    stablisation fields - allows for different materials to be launched like radioactive things or something
    thrusters - faster time to go to station. shorter launch cooldown
    loading bays - resources enter ship faster

  Ships phase 2
    similar to first ships thewill be used to send resources to the station except they are nolonger single use
    idea 1
      each plaent has its own ships that bottle neck their exports
    idea 2
      ships are built in the staaion and are allocated to plaents allowing for changing of bottlenecks if 1 resource is more requirted than another 
    being built into stations makes it simpaer to upgraded patertar exports
  
  planets phase 2
    mining could be simplified into a tierd system to simplify it. because going thru lotsa of different planets woulb be annoing
    having planet upgrades be simplified would make it less futrationg if there are alot of plantets
    other plaent system ideas
      have each grid of exploirtaion be worth say a planet point
      you can then allkocate plaent poinmts to differing planetmining operations
      the initial lanign area will always have enough points to purchase basics
      list of point ideas
      exploration HQ first thing you buy required to unlock all else unrefundable
      launch pad levels
      drill levels
      


research
  labratory
  have permanenbt upgrades that affect all operations every where
  lock differing mechanics behind research like exploration
  uses reaeach exclusive currency
  skill tree (i like skill trees)
    10% drill power
    10% exploration speeds
  prefeably keep these numbers lower like start in the 1s and go big is like the 1000s
  keeps it more readable as this is a core progession system
    obtaining
      pay large amount of resources per point
      milestones to to aquire points
      machines that generate the resource (not very good make realy slow so that you cant just make point gain machines to blitz thru resaerch)
radar
  upgrade to unlockj new plantes to go to like boom beach radar
  most planets acesssable thru radar
  list within radar that is soraqtable for differnt panets with different resources
  also have a visual star map thatr shows plantes and station
  main progression system of phase 2

expeditions
  discoverd planets require an expeditionary force to scout before resource gathering operations can begin can begin
  her you will buy groups and send them to planets to explore areas
  groups can be upgradable allowing them to be able to explore certain tiles faster
  upgrades will make the expedition finish scouting faster and also be less likeley to die
  will go on cooldown if taken oput adn will have to wait to get them to recover
  planets will have different types like
  water planet
  ateriod field
  dry
  mountains
  jungle
  Tile effects
    steepness
    danger
    hostility
  planetary exploration in hex grid because i like the lookj of hex grids
  you must explore an area the you could get a [planet point]

drop down folders
open top to reveal layers below
use full if there are alot of planets or for seperating phases
e.g
earth
  ores
  refinement
  ships

have gain next to currency

have icons for these

exploration grid in hexagons
becaue they look cool

over upgrades and buyables and stuff
